# debian-desktop-playbook
A personal **Ansible** **Playbook** to deploy/configure a **Debian** desktop system to my needs with **KDE** (**Xfce** is also available) and many additional packages.

Adapted for **Debian 12** (**Bookworm**)

## Features:
- **KDE** desktop by default enabled and **Xfce** (**Task**) available.
- Many additional packages from the official repos (**LibreOffice**, **Firefox-ESR**, etc.)
- Installs and configures **sudo** and **doas** (**opendoas**)
- **Flatpaks**: **Discord**, **Element**, **Signal**, **Raspberry Pi Imager**, **JDownloader**
- External applications available: **Docker**, **Virtualbox**, **Mullvad (Client)**, **VSCodium**, **Brave**, **VeraCrypt**
- Gaming: **Steam**, **Wine**, **Minecraft**  and retro gaming emulators (**Mupen64Plus**, **Mednafen/Mednaffe**)
- Targets **Intel**/**AMD** systems (CPU/GPU)
- Virtualization packages (**libvirt/QEMU/Virt-Manager**)
- Also installs **PowerShell**
- Installs **Mono** / **.NET SDK**
- Install the **Liquorix** Linux Kernel
- Install the **XanMod** Linux Kernel (**LTS**)
- (**Optional**) Installs and sets up **UFW** (**Deny** incoming, **Allow** outgoing, allow **SSH** access)
- Most software comes from the main repos!

## Note on external applications:
External applications are only installed when the "external" variable is set to true.   
Keep that in mind when using this **Playbook**.   
I made the decision to make these not be installed by default since I personally perefer things from the official repo or installed as a **Flatpak**.

There is nothing big to see here. I like the defaults and don't really change much of anything. YMMV. ðŸ˜Ž

## Hint
This Playbook mainly servers my own needs - feel free to adapt it to yours!

You can find many more variables under the **vars** directory - Make sure you take a look before running the **Playbook**. (So you can customize your install)

The **dotfiles** tasks installs my own config files. This might not be what you need - be sure to exclude the **role** when not needed. (This can be done via **tags**)

## Before running the Playbook:
- Set the variables you need
- Take a look at the **dotfiles** role, since you most likely want to use your own dots!

## Usage:
1. Clone/download this repository
2. Unpack/cd into the directory
3. Run
```shell
$ ansible-playbook main.yml (-Kk)
```
4. The target will reboot when the playbook is finished running
5. Done

## Examples
All tasks can be selected via **Tags**, so you can pick whatever tasks you want to run.   
Following, a couple of use cases:
1. Run all tasks
```bash
$ ansible-playbook main.yml --tags all (-Kk)
```
2. Only run a subset of tasks
```bash
$ ansible-playbook main.yml --tags "apt,vim,sysctl,grub,reboot" (-Kk)
```
3. Run only one task
```bash
$ ansible-playbook main.yml --tags "flatpak" (-Kk)
```
All available **Tags**:
```bash
apt
upgrade
vim
dotfiles
postfix
sshd
sudo
doas
groups
ntp
sysctl

## Note:
Make sure you have set the correct IP/Hostname in the **hosts** file.   

**BEWARE:** do **_NOT_** run this Playbook blindly!

## Ubuntu
Certain tasks will run on **Ubuntu** and **Ubuntu** based systems.
Beware though that this **Playbook** was not tested on any **Ubuntu** system!
Make sure to check the tasks to see what they actually do before running this on any **Ubuntu** based system!
